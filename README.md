## Project Overview
Maraine version 2 is a school management system built on a monolithic architecture. The project was inspired from the fundamental need I observed in my school at the time for a simple system where students and teachers can easily communicate, pass and submit assignments easily.

The project turned out to be an amazing one because I learned a lot about systems, databases, data structures and algorithms, and fundamental web development principles.
